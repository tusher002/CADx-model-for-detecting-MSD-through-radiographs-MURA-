It is a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) model that can help the doctors to identify musculoskeletal abnormalities through radiographs. Our proposed technique tested on a benchmark radiographic dataset named ‘MURA’. We collect this dataset from Stanfrd University ML group. We have worked with seven upper extremity. They are: Wrist, Hand, Humerous, Shoulder, Finger, Elbow, and Forearm.
