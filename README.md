It is a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) model that can help the doctors to identify musculoskeletal abnormalities through radiographs. Our proposed technique tested on a benchmark radiographic dataset named ‘MURA’. We collect this dataset from Stanfrd University ML group. We have worked with seven upper extremity. They are: Wrist, Hand, Humerous, Shoulder, Finger, Elbow, and Forearm.

This Hybrid approach generates .729, .644, .743, and .753 in terms of Cohen's Kappa Statistics respectively for Elbow, Finger, Humerus, and Wrist which is relatively better than other classifiers in terms of performance metrics.
